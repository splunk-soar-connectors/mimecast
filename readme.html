    <h2>Playbook Backward Compatibility</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The newer version of the app updates the action names for blacklist and whitelist actions. Hence, it is requested to
          the end-user to please update their existing playbooks by modifying the corresponding action blocks to ensure the
          correct functioning of the playbooks created on the earlier versions of the app. The following actions names have been
          updated:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>[blacklist url] to [blocklist url]</li>
          <li>[unblacklist url] to [unblocklist url]</li>
          <li>[whitelist url] to [allowlist url]</li>
          <li>[unwhitelist url] to [unallowlist url]</li>
          <li>[blacklist sender] to [blocklist sender]</li>
          <li>[whitelist sender] to [allowlist sender]</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Added new paremeter in the action given below. Hence, it is requested to the end-user to please update their existing playbooks by re-inserting | modifying | deleting the corresponding action blocks or by providing appropriate values to these action parameters to ensure the correct functioning of the playbooks created on the earlier versions of the app.
          <ul>
            <li>list urls - 'max_results' parameter has been added</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>State file Backward Compatibility</h2>
    <p>
      If you're upgrading the application from a version 2.2.1 or earlier, please make sure to execute the 'test connectivity' action before running any other action. Because the sensitive values stored in the state file are now encrypted before storing and decrypted before using. The connector will handle everything, but any previously saved keys will not work correctly. Fresh key pairs should be generated after running the 'test connectivity' action, and all other actions should work after this. This is applicable for 'Cloud' and 'Domain' authentication only.
    </p>

    <h2>SDK and SDK Licensing details for the app</h2>
    <p>
      <h3>python_dateutil</h3>
      This app uses the python_dateutil module, which is licensed under the Apache Software License, BSD License (Dual License), Copyright (c) Gustavo Niemeyer.
    </p>

    <h2>Authorization</h2>

    <p>To create an API application and user association key ('Access Key' and 'Secret Key' for bypass authentication), please refer to the <a href="https://community.mimecast.com/s/article/Managing-API-Applications-505230018" target="_blank">Mimecast document</a>.</p>
    <p>For the 'Mimecast Base URL' configuration field, please refer to the <a href="https://integrations.mimecast.com/documentation/api-overview/global-base-urls/" target="_blank">Global Base URLS</a> article. You can select URL based on your Mimecast region.</p>

    <h2>Points to remember while connecting to Mimecast</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>IP Range Restrictions:</b> Be sure to enable your Mimecast to accept communication with the IP address of your Splunk SOAR server(s).</li>
      <li><b>Two Factor Authentication:</b> Mimecast supports optional two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication should be disabled for the account that handles API interactions with Splunk SOAR in order to use 'Cloud' or 'Domain' authentication.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <b>Note:</b>
      The 'unblocklist url' and 'unallowlist url' actions use the same API endpoint and action parameter to remove the URL from the blocklist and allowlist. Hence, removing the URL from the allowlist will automatically remove the URL from the blocklist as well.
    </p>
    <h2 id="port-information">Port Information</h2>
    <p>The app uses HTTP/ HTTPS protocol for communicating with the Mimecast server. Below are the default ports used by Splunk SOAR.</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr class="header">
            <th>SERVICE NAME</th>
            <th>TRANSPORT PROTOCOL</th>
            <th>PORT</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr class="odd">
            <td><strong>http</strong></td>
            <td>tcp</td>
            <td>80</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="even">
            <td><strong>https</strong></td>
            <td>tcp</td>
